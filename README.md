## Subgradient Descent
This small project consist of a python script that experiments with different specific implementations of the subgradient descent to find local minimums. This script is part of a homework assignment of the course Introduction to Convex Optimization given in the second semester of 2016 at Universidad de los Andes.

The file *TareaB.pdf* contains the homework assignment and the file *entrega_tarea_2.pdf* the hand in file requiered by the class.
